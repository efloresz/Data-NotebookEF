- Understand the data and describe the data using Python libraries 

# Identify 3 ways the data can be cleaned 
## The data can be cleaned by reordering the 'created_at' attribute by date added.
### *Most recent tweet at the top of data set & oldest tweets at the end*
## The data can be cleaned by reorganizing the 'author_id' by alphabetic order.
### *Start with 'author_id' that starts with 'a' & ends with 'z'
## I noticed there are repeated 'author_id' we can group them together.
### *While maintaining the 'author_id' in alphabetic order*
### *This will make it easier to access tweets from certain users* 


- How many inbound & outbound responses are in the dataset?
